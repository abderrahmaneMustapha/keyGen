# KeyGen

“Key Generator” app coding. A key generator is a  program that generates a product licensing key. This is a coding challenge
follows modern application-design standards of having a centralized back-end with separate clients.


## Backend 
the server side , or the API , follow a RESTfull architecture, and based on mvc 
in this application im following a good project structuring practice mnetioned on [node best practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices/blob/master/sections/projectstructre/breakintcomponents.md) repository.
which is struturing by component and not by  technical role

as we can see on the figure above , we have 3 application ( component) each one contains a controller , routes, models , and services.

im still working on the keys app, and for the other two apps users and products , i will add them in future versions

## Frontend

for the client side part im using react-native + ant design to help me build a good UI faster
